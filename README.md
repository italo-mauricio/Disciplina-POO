    <h1>Object-Oriented Programming Learning Repository</h1>
    <p>This repository is designed for the Object-Oriented Programming course and will serve future students who are learning object-oriented programming in college and will need these contents. It will contain various examples, exercises, and projects aimed at helping students understand key concepts and improve their programming skills..</p>
    <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that focuses on objects rather than functions or procedures. In OOP, objects are instances of classes, which define the attributes and behaviors of the objects. OOP allows for more modular, flexible, and maintainable code, which is why it is a popular programming paradigm in many industries.</p>
    <p>The projects in this repository are designed to give students hands-on experience with OOP. The projects range in complexity and cover a variety of topics, including inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. The repository also includes examples of OOP concepts in popular programming languages like Java, Python, and C++, Dart.</p>
    <p>Feel free to explore the repository and use the examples and projects to improve your understanding of OOP. If you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to reach out to the repository owner. We hope this repository helps you on your journey to becoming a better programmer!</p>
